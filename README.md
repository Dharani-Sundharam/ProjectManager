# Project Manager

This project is a simple user management and login system with a graphical user interface (GUI). It includes features like user authentication, separate databases for different users, and a main database for user credentials. The project uses Python and Tkinter for the UI, and SQL for database management.

## Features

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Username and password login page
   - Password hashing and salting for security

2. **Database Management:**
   - Separate databases for different users
   - Main database for user credentials

3. **Graphical User Interface:**
   - Simple UI for user interaction
   - Future plans to enhance UI using Tkinter

4. **Project Workflow:**
   - Initial setup and configuration
   - Creating and managing databases
   - Developing a functional UI
   - Adding, updating, and saving data in SQL

8. **Step 8:** Work done tab development (In progress)
9. **Step 9:** Database creation using SQL, CSV, or Excel (Pending decision)
10. **Step 10:** Choosing SQL for its architecture and cloud support (Decided)
11. **Step 11:** Functions for adding, updating, and saving SQL files (To be developed)
12. **Step 12:** Consideration for using classes (Decided against to avoid complexity)
13. **Step 13:** Execution of the above steps and continued development

## Future Enhancements
